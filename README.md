ER Modelling for Go
===================

Entity-Relationship (ER) models are a powerful tool for designing software. 
They are based upon descriptive diagrams of real-world entities, possessing 
attributes and connected to one another by quantity relationships.

This repository maintains a collection of packages that are useful in 
manipulating a particular kind of ER model. What makes this approach unusual 
is that relationships can be annotated with constraints so that the 
logical-to-physical transformation is "right first time." The 
theoretical basis of this is elucidated on http://www.entitymodelling.org - 
what you find here is merely an alternative implementation of the same 
concepts.
